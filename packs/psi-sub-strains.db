The hallucination may be as subtle as seeing something crawling under an NPC’s skin to as immersive as suddenly finding yourself in an alien environment, but it lasts no more than a few minutes. If you have cause to disbelieve the illusion, you may make an INT Check to spot the falsehood; even if successful, however, the hallucination will still play out. Some hallucinations may just provide unnerving or horrifying experiences, a sign that the universe is unraveling around you. Others may provide obfuscated insights, reveal hidden connections, or hint at things to come.","active":null,"name":"Hallucination","roll":6,"duration":86400000,"effects":{"items":[],"interval":"actionTurns","durationFormula":"0"},"id":"3e7y92tge2"},{"type":"trait","description":"","active":null,"roll":2,"trait":{"_id":"21u1txyoRP3Jmi3B","name":"Enhanced Behavior: Avoidance","permission":{"default":0,"qHi89sFcK4gHlOPd":3},"type":"trait","system":{"description":"<p><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">You acquire an intolerance for a</span><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\"> </span><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">specific type of sensory input: smells, sounds, light, darkness, etc.</span><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\"> </span><span style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\">You will go to great lengths to avoid</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your conduct or moods are modified.

Your instinctual responses are different from those of your original phenotype and you occasionally find yourself acting in ways more fitting to a physiology different from yours. You might feel a weird compulsion to burrow into sand, lay eggs, eat non-nutritious or dangerous substances, or clean phantom appendages that aren&rsquo;t part of your current anatomy. You may even seek out morphs that better accommodate these omnipresent urges. You sometimes express an outlook that other transhumans find strange, just as you are occasionally confused or mystified by transhuman cultural practices. When the infection expresses itself strongly, these omnipresent urges seem quite normal, but the transhumans around you seem more and more bizarre and alien.
