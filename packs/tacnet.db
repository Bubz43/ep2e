They are used by sports teams, security/military units, gamers, and anyone else that needs to coordinate actions. Tacnets provide the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maps</strong>: Tacnets present maps from a bird&rsquo;s eye, three-dimensional interactive, or first-person entoptic view, tagging notable features and marking distances. They can also plot maps based on sensory input, positioning systems, and other data.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Positioning</strong>: Tacnets indicate the position of known people, bots, vehicles, and other features according to sensory input or their calculated trajectories. Friend-or-foe tags highlight allies and opponents, noting their lines of sight and fields of fire and alerting the user to areas of potential cover or danger.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Sensory Input</strong>: Tacnets share all sensory input available from members and linked devices. This includes data from physical senses, portable sensors, smartlink guncams, XP feeds, etc. Users can immediately call up and access the sensor feeds of others as needed.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Communications Management</strong>: Tacnets maintain an encrypted VPN between users.

The app's god&rsquo;s-eye view of a situation helps it to identify facts and details that individuals overlook.
