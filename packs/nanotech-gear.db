Vats preserve biomorphs in nutrient gel crawling with medical nanobots, while injection lines pump the body full of medichine swarms. They quickly assess your health, mend bones, heal wounds, regenerate limbs, and otherwise repair your biological form (Healing &amp; Repair ▶221). With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues and certain kinds of neurological damage, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as you are alive when you are placed in the healing vat, you will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch, given enough time. A healing vat can even take your severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on your head&rsquo;s genetics.</p>\n<p>Medical care is not all that healing vats are used for &mdash; they are also the safest way to sculpt your body or install various bioware, cyberware, and nanoware systems. Specialized nanomachines are used to grow the ware inside your body or otherwise customize your form.
