A single charge can be used to create an explosive blast inflicting DV 6d10 + 10 [43] when set with Hardware: Demolitions. A charge can be shaped with a successful Hardware: Demolitions Test, focusing the blast in a particular 90-degree direction (for example, to blow through a door). This triples the damage of the blast in the focused direction; in all other directions, the damage is reduced to 1/3rd.
