They are primarily used as a non-lethal method of immobilizing or securing a target. Struck characters must immediately make a REF Check or become trapped; treat as the grappled condition ▶226. Breaking free requires a SOM Check by the trapped target (at -30 ) or an outside helper. The attacker's superior successes can be used to apply a cumulative -10 modifier to these checks. Additional shots can be used to apply more layers to a trapped target (each requiring a SOM Check to break free). The foam allows characters to breathe even if their mouth and nose are covered, but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked with contact toxins or drugs to additionally incapacitate the target. It can also be used to construct temporary barricades or cover (creating moderate cover for 1 person per shot). Hardened foam has an Armor of 5/10 and Durability of 20.
