This makes you exceptionally resistant to drugs and toxins, including everything from recreational chemicals to nerve agents to spoiled food. You can even safely and comfortably breathe smoke and drink salt water. Make a SOM Check when dosed with a biochem drug or toxin; it only affects you if you fail. If affected, apply a +30 modifier to all aptitude checks made to resist specific effects. Additionally, all drug/toxin effects and durations are reduced by half (if you also have medichines, they are negated entirely). This augmentation provides no resistance to concentrated acid, nanotechnological attacks, pathogens, or similar destructive agents.</p>","reference":"Eclipse Phase Second Edition p. 323","complexity":"major","restricted":false,"quality":"average","concealable":false,"fragile":false,"singleUse":false,"twoHanded":false,"blueprint":{"blueprintType":"","cracked":false,"used":false},"state":{"disabled":false,"equipped":false,"fabStartTime":0,"activated":false,"embeddedEgos":[],"onboardAliDeleted":false},"activatedEffects":[],"deviceType":"","category":"Combat Augments","fabricator":"","activationAction":"automatic","passiveEffects":[{"type":"duration","subtype":"drugOrToxin","modifier":-50,"taskType":"","cummulative":false,"halve":false,"id":"rbudig9o0u"},{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"+30 to apt checks to resist drugs/toxins","id":"otfae1kyup"}],"activation":"none","resistEffectsCheck":"","usedEffectsDuration":3000,"onboardALI":false,"firewallRating":30,"fabPrintDuration":0,"firewallHealth":{"baseDurability":30,"rebootEndTime":-1,"crashWounds":0,"damage":0,"log":[],"wounds":0},"meshHealth":{"baseDurability":20,"damage":0,"wounds":0,"aidedHealTickStartTime":0,"ownHealTickStartTime":0,"damageRepair":{"amount":"1d10","interval":86400000},"woundRepair":{"amount":1,"interval":86400000},"log":[],"rebootEndTime":-1,"crashWounds":0},"wareType":"bioware"},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"IEj4NCLqUCjDFrhy"}
