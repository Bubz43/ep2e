{"name":"Autocook","permission":{"default":0,"qJl17WpEHiovQQBC":3},"type":"physicalTech","data":{"description":"<p>Autocooks are specialized fabricators that only produce food and drinks. At the low end (Minor complexity), autocooks are small sized and can produce water, various flavored beverages, ration bars, thick pudding-like edible gels, and similar dry or gooey foods. Most units have a very limited range of flavors and textures that are widely considered to be fairly bad. Higher-end units (Moderate and Major complexity) are small or even medium sized and can manufacture and synthesize better foods, up to and including gourmet meals and alcohol, as well as similar organics, such as fabric, leather, and some medicines. Raw materials can be provided by the addition of any water-containing liquid and collected biomass like leftover food, grass, dirt, dead animals, or transhuman waste. With adequate raw material, an autocook can indefinitely provide food and drink for up to three transhumans.</p>","reference":"","complexity":"minor","restricted":false,"quality":"average","concealable":false,"fragile":false,"singleUse":false,"twoHanded":false,"blueprint":{"blueprintType":"","cracked":false,"used":false},"state":{"disabled":false,"equipped":false,"fabStartTime":0,"activated":false,"embeddedEgos":[],"onboardAliDeleted":false},"activatedEffects":[],"deviceType":"","category":"Specialized Fabbers","fabricator":"specialized","activationAction":"automatic","passiveEffects":[{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"Fab food and drink only.","id":"n5i4sdcum1"}],"activation":"none","resistEffectsCheck":"","usedEffectsDuration":3000,"onboardALI":false,"firewallRating":30,"fabPrintDuration":0,"firewallHealth":{"baseDurability":30,"rebootEndTime":-1,"crashWounds":0,"damage":0,"log":[],"wounds":0},"meshHealth":{"baseDurability":20,"damage":0,"wounds":0,"aidedHealTickStartTime":0,"ownHealTickStartTime":0,"damageRepair":{"amount":"1d10","interval":86400000},"woundRepair":{"amount":1,"interval":86400000},"log":[],"rebootEndTime":-1,"crashWounds":0},"wareType":""},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"t6HsoEZLWzkDWxTb"}
