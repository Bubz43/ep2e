It is large, with a size of 8 cubic meters (in a cube 2 meters on a side), but can be loaded onto large vehicles. To function, it must be connected to a large power plant, such as one found in habitats or large spacecraft. The cost and size of this device includes the computer necessary for quantum farcasting. Because it is exceptionally safe and secure, quantum farcasting via neutrino communications is the primary means of both long-distance communication between habitats and egocasting. The neutrino signal cannot be blocked and it can only be decrypted if a character has access to the computer that is sending or receiving the signal.</p>","reference":"Eclipse Phase Second Edition p. 336","complexity":"rare","restricted":false,"quality":"average","concealable":false,"fragile":false,"singleUse":false,"twoHanded":false,"blueprint":{"blueprintType":"","cracked":false,"used":false},"state":{"disabled":false,"equipped":false,"fabStartTime":0,"activated":false,"embeddedEgos":[],"onboardAliDeleted":false},"activatedEffects":[],"deviceType":"","category":"Neutrino Comms Gear","fabricator":"","activationAction":"automatic","passiveEffects":[{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"Sends/receives neutrino comms, 100+ AU range.","id":"9557lbypk1"}],"activation":"none","resistEffectsCheck":"","usedEffectsDuration":3000,"onboardALI":false,"firewallRating":30,"fabPrintDuration":0,"firewallHealth":{"baseDurability":30,"rebootEndTime":-1,"crashWounds":0,"damage":0,"log":[],"wounds":0},"meshHealth":{"baseDurability":20,"damage":0,"wounds":0,"aidedHealTickStartTime":0,"ownHealTickStartTime":0,"damageRepair":{"amount":"1d10","interval":86400000},"woundRepair":{"amount":1,"interval":86400000},"log":[],"rebootEndTime":-1,"crashWounds":0},"wareType":""},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"7hMSZroXWoQsnQ6h"}
