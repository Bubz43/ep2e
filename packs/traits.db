At the GM’s discretion, however, using Resources may require an appropriate Persuade Test (to convince another party to part ways with the item) or perhaps a Research Test (to find a source).</p><p>Levels 3 and 4 of this trait imply an amount of resources that deems you wealthy. To reflect this, you can use 2 of your weekly GP in conjunction with a Flex point for narrative control to say that you have a Moderate gear item immediately on hand in your home/ vehicle/personal possessions. You must have access to your personal possessions and (as with all uses of Flex for narrative control) the item must be plausible.</p><p>Resources can also apply as a modifier for certain tests. For example, if you attempt to bribe a triad goon or use your credit score to arrange a meeting with a potential business partner, apply a +10 modifier for each level of Resources you possess.</p><p>While Resources is an abstract measurement, players and GMs should use it as a rough benchmark for a character’s personal assets and lifestyle. A character with Level 1 might have their own cubicle in a beehive hab or a small apartment in a Martian dome or O’Neill cylinder’s working class areas, and they get around by bike or public transit. A character with Level 2 Resources might have a private residence on a small station or a condo in a larger hab, as well as a minicar or cycle to get around. A character with Level 3 could have a large residential complex or multiple homes, plus one or more vehicles. A Level 4 character is rich and might own a small private hab and even their own shuttle.</p><p>Your Resources trait may be affected by events in game. If your home is destroyed or you come across a secret cache of riches, the GM should adjust your trait level accordingly. You must pay the extra cost in Rez Points if your trait goes up, but you receive an RP credit if your wealth goes down.</p><p>In desperate circumstances, you may also intentionally burn your Resources to refresh your weekly GP to get something you urgently need (or get it more quickly). This represents the expenditure of all or major portions of your assets with no hope of reclaiming them and no RP reimbursement. The GM should reduce your Resources trait level by an amount appropriate to the transaction.</p>","reference":"Eclipse Phase Second Edition p. 75","restrictions":"","triggers":"","source":"ego","state":{"level":0,"triggered":false},"levels":[{"cost":2,"effects":[{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"You can spend up to 2 GP per week on Minor complexity items given the appropriate time frame","id":"ljwq8ae2jw"},{"type":"successTest","tags":[{"type":"skillCategory","category":"social"}],"modifier":10,"toOpponent":false,"requirement":"using your wealth","id":"z3hn7x0sey"}],"id":"9ijgbb3gal"},{"cost":4,"effects":[{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"You can spend up to 3 GP per week on Minor or Moderate complexity items given the appropriate time frame","id":"brqkznj3f8"},{"type":"successTest","tags":[{"type":"skillCategory","category":"social"}],"modifier":20,"toOpponent":false,"requirement":"using your wealth","id":"1iccyhdw0c"}],"id":"xv1h55zz9y"},{"cost":6,"effects":[{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"You can spend up to 5 GP per week on items of any complexity, given the appropriate time frame","id":"35r60wmgsk"},{"type":"successTest","tags":[{"type":"skillCategory","category":"social"}],"modifier":30,"toOpponent":false,"requirement":"using your wealth","id":"3jv6wz6w2r"}],"id":"qnxwlef0ai"},{"cost":8,"effects":[{"type":"misc","unique":"","description":"You can spend up to 5 GP per week on items of any complexity, given the appropriate time frame, this may also include Rare or Restricted items (GM's discretion)","id":"xw9oenib36"},{"type":"successTest","tags":[{"type":"skillCategory","category":"social"}],"modifier":40,"toOpponent":false,"requirement":"using your wealth","id":"pieapwjcaq"}],"id":"ekalh2g5g3"}],"subtype":"","traitType":"positive"},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
