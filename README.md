# Unofficial Eclipse Phase 2e System for Foundry VTT

Heavily automated [Eclipse Phase 2e](https://www.eclipsephase.com) system.

## Maintenance mode 

The is largely stable, but there are rough edges and unfinished features. It is foundry 12 compatible. Discoverability of features is sometimes a bit lacking, and a [discord](https://discord.gg/zs4jMnFqjx) server is available if you have any questions or want to talk with other users of the system. It is currently in maintenance mode (critical bugs/foundry compat only) until the rewrite is complete.

### Notable missing features and issues

- Transations are not setup properly. For languages other than English you would be best served waiting for the rewrite. 

- Proper support for hives
- Modular morphs, e.g. flexbots
- Jamming

## Incompatible modules

- PopOut! - The way it works is largely incompatible with how UI elements are rendered. An alternative, albeit a more resource intensive one, is to open a new tab with the same url.
- TurnMarker - The system uses a custom combat tracker to better support Eclipse Phase options, which is sadly incompatible with this module.

### **Future**

Making this has be quite a learning experience and mistakes have been made. Some of these will require fundamental design changes. These are extensive enough that this will take the form of a total rewrite. The current iteration of the system will continue to be supported until the next one is ready. The next iteration will not be backwards compatible with the current one, though a world migrator _might_ be feasible. More details to come...
